# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in actively participating in the project's development!
Please read the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/repath-project/repath-studio/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
and the [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md) first.

The project is written in [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) - a compiler for
[Clojure](https://clojure.org/) that targets JavaScript, and is based on
[re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/) - a framework for building Modern Web Apps
in ClojureScript. You should probably take a look at their
[exceptional documentation](https://day8.github.io/re-frame/re-frame/) first.

## Style Guide

We try to follow the [Clojure Style Guide](https://guide.clojure.style/) as much as
possible.

An additional resource about [how to name Clojure functions](https://stuartsierra.com/2016/01/09/how-to-name-clojure-functions)
by Stuart Sierra.

In addition to the [idiomatic names](https://guide.clojure.style/#idiomatic-names),
we use the following conventions

```text
e           -> event
el, els     -> element, elements
attr, attrs -> attribute, attributes
prop, props -> property, properties
w, h        -> width, height
t           -> time
h, m, s, ms -> hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds
```

## App structure

Main structure

<div class="highlight">
<pre>
src\
├── renderer\ -> <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/process-model#the-renderer-process"
                 >Renderer Process</a>
├── electron\ -> <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/process-model#the-main-process"
                 >Main Process</a> & <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/process-model#preload-scripts"
                 >Preload script</a>
├── lang\     -> Translation files
└── worker\   -> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API"
                 >Web Workers</a>
</pre>
</div>

We are trying to split our code under renderer into relatively independent modules,
following [re-frame's app structure suggestions](https://day8.github.io/re-frame/App-Structure/)
with some minor additions.

```text
module\
├── core.cljs      -> entry point
├── db.cljs        -> schema, validation
├── views.cljs     -> reagent views
├── events.cljs    -> event handlers
├── subs.cljs      -> subscription handlers
├── handlers.cljs  -> helper functions for db transformations
├── effects.cljs   -> effect handlers
├── hierarchy.cljs -> multimethods and hierarchies
├── styles.css     -> styles
└── README.md      -> documentation
```

## Re-frame recommendations

Avoid chaining events to create new ones. Always prefer composing pure functions that
directly transform the db. That is the whole purpose of `handlers` namespace.

Use interceptors sparingly. Although they look (and probably are) ingenious, it is hard
to write and reason with them. Doing things explicitly, is usually easier to grasp and
maintain.

Always use auto-qualified keywords (e.g. `::copy`) for subscriptions, events and effects.
You can use `as-alias` to require those namespaces without evaluating the registrations
multiple times.

## Spec

We use [malli](https://github.com/metosin/malli) to describe the shape of our app db and
selectively validate incoming data (e.g. file loading). We also use this spec to generate
default values. Full db validation is enabled on dev mode.

[Function schemas](https://github.com/metosin/malli/blob/master/docs/function-schemas.md#defn-schemas)
are selectively applied to pure and critical namespaces, such as utils and handlers.
By default, function schemas are instrumented only during tests to avoid performance
overhead. However, runtime instrumentation can also be enabled in the development
environment (see `renderer.dev`).
