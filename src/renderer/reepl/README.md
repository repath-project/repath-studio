# Repl module

Based on [reepl](https://github.com/jaredly/reepl) by Jared Forsyth under
[ISC License](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC)

## Changes

- Shadow-cljs build
- Conform with replumb [breaking changes](https://github.com/arichiardi/replumb#usage)
- Parinfer removed
- Multiple view and style changes
- Separate styles

## Todo

- Use re-frame to store and retrieve state to global app-db

## Considerations

Maybe switch to [SCI](https://github.com/borkdude/sci) that is simpler, safer
and it works when compiled with :advanced.
