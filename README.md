Repath Studio is a cross platform vector graphics editor, that combines
procedural tooling with traditional design workflows. It includes an interactive
shell, which allows evaluating code to generate shapes, or even extend the
editor on the fly. Supporting multiple programming languages and enriching the
existing API is planned. The tool relies heavily on the
[SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) specification,
and aims to educate users about it. Creating and editing
[SMIL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/SVG_animation_with_SMIL)
animations - an SVG extension – is an important aspect of the project, that is
yet to be fully implemented. An advanced undo/redo mechanism is used to maintain
a full history tree of actions in memory, so users will never lose their redo
stack.

## Rationale

### Why is this implemented as a web application?

- Using the main targeting platform to also create your SVGs, ensures that what
  you see while editing, is as close as possible to what you are going to get
  when you load your exported creations.
- Avoid re-implementing complex specifications, like SMIL.
- Access to JavaScript ecosystem.
- Being able to serve this as website is a huge plus.

### Why is the desktop app wrapped with ElectronJS?

- Electron is a mature framework with a rich API.
- Embedded Chromium ensures that web APIs will work consistently across multiple
  operating systems.
- Using the same rendering engine promotes UI consistency.
- We can use the same language to develop our backend and frontend.

### Why ClojureScript?

- Built-in immutability.
- Easy data manipulation.
- Stability of libraries.
- Interoperability with js and react.
- Clean syntax.

### What about performance?

We are currently trying to optimize for hundreds of elements per document. We
are also testing a canvas based implementation that can handle thousands of
nodes on a single document, but that's not within the current scope of the
project.

## How to build it locally

### System Requirements

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Java SDK (8+) [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/) or
  [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure)

### Shell instructions

Clone the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/repath-studio/repath-studio.git
```

Go into the directory.

```bash
cd repath-studio
```

Install the dependencies, build the app and watch the project files.

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

When the build process is complete, you can then visit the following addresses
on your browser:

- `http://localhost:8080` - The web application
- `http://localhost:8081` - The test runner
- `http://localhost:8082` - The components portfolio

If you want to open the electron app, execute the following on a different
terminal.

```bash
npm run electron
```
